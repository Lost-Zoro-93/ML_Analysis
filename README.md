## ðŸš€ Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of machine learning projects developed to demonstrate my applied ML capabilities in real-world use cases. 
Each project focuses on solving a unique regression or classification problem using industry-standard workflows: data preprocessing, feature engineering, 
model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

### ðŸ“¦ Projects Included

* **ðŸ”§ Predictive Maintenance (RUL Detection):**
  A regression-based project to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of mechanical systems using sensor data and time-series preprocessing techniques.

* **â›½ Fuel Efficiency Prediction:**
  Predicts a vehicle's miles-per-gallon (MPG) using features like engine displacement, horsepower, weight, and acceleration. Compares multiple models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest.

### ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated

* Data cleaning & imputation
* Outlier detection
* Feature scaling & encoding
* Regression modeling (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest)
* Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
* Cross-validation (K-Fold, CV pipelines)
* Model evaluation (MSE, RMSE, RÂ²)
* Visualizations (pair plots, reg plots, feature importances)
